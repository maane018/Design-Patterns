**Approach Description**:

Hard coded the buttons and wrote an implementation of push.

**Pros of this approach**:

**Cons of this approach**:

1. Everything is hard coded here. Any change in the appliances and we'll have to change the whole logic/code.
2. Let's say we need to interchange 2nd and 4th button, we'll have to change our code.

**Learnings**:

1. Use dependency injection if the task is not fixed.
